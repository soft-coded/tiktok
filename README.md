Thank you all for your love and support for the website. It is no longer live, becuase it was simply costing me too much to keep it up by now. Check out the videos below to see how the website looked on PC as well as mobile.

## DISCLAIMER
**This web app is absolutely not linked to the actual TikTok company or ByteDance in any way. Tiktok, Tiktok logo, the website and basically everything I used here is a registered trademark/copyright/any other legal ownership thing of ByteDance/Tiktok.** This is just a project that I decided to build on my own because it looked like it would be fun. I do not have any plans to make this a commercial app or anything of that sort. Just something to put on my CV.

_TLDR: Please don't sue me._

Disclaimer has also been added to the website:

## TOOLS USED
* Typescript React
* Redux toolkit
* SCSS and its modules
* Font-awesome icons (only the free ones, sorry font-awesome)
* Node js for backend. [Backend repository](https://github.com/soft-coded/tiktok-server)

## DEPLOYMENT
* [Currently deployed on netlify.](https://sc-react-tiktok.netlify.app/)
* Links will be added here if I change/deploy the website anywhere else.

## ISSUES
* Back button does not close comments modal
  * This is not a solvable issue. The real Tiktok website also has this problem. This is because the back button does not fire any event, so it extremely difficult to know when it is pressed. For the time being, just use the dedicated close button or click outside the comments modal.

* Swipe animation is laggy on iOS
  * This is actually [an issue with iOS itself.](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper/issues/4493)

* "Following" page repeats videos
  * This stems in the lack of a recommendation algorithm and I'm afraid I cannot code one due to my extreme lack of machine learning skills. If I find an implementation I'll add it, otherwise you'll have to look past this one.

* Videos load slowly
  * The server has 1 GB RAM. I honestly think it's incredible that it is able to load videos at all.

[Let me know](https://github.com/soft-coded/tiktok/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) if you find any other bugs/issues.

## Q'N'A
### "Why Tiktok?"
No particular reason. I had been wanting to make a "big 💯👌" project for a while now. I juggled around with the idea of building any one of all the major social media apps and Tiktok seemed to be (and I mean this very loosely) the fastest and easiest one to build. Turns out I was wrong. Very wrong.

One thing that I can assure you is that one person can't (and shouldn't 🙂) re-create big social media websites alone.

### "Does Tiktok use React?"
Yes, actually. At least for the webapp. Next.js to be precise. And I realised just now that Tiktok in React could also just mean the original Tiktok (please don't sue me 😐).

### "How long did it take for you to make this?"
3 months and counting. Started in the first week of November 2021. #Grind😤

### "What if you get sued?"
Please don't 😐
